About this project.

04/26/2023.
This is currently in phase 1, a proof of concept. The functionality is limited, and design was kept minimal in order to allow for future change.
I utilized the React javascript framework for all functionality, and Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap for all user interface and design elements.
